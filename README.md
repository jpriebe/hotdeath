Hot Death is a variation of the classic card game, Uno.

This is a labor of love for me, as I have enjoyed the original Hot Death Uno for many years. I wish I had more specifics about who invented it, but I first saw it in electronic form in the mid 90s, as a Visual Basic application for Windows. I ported it to Pocket PC in the early 2000s, and now it is here for Android.
