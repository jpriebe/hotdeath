Version 0.9                 2011-04-23
Initial Release


Version 0.9.1				2011-05-02
 - redraw table after player passes (so you can see the next player "thinking")
 - tap to dismiss card help dialog
 - graphical game winner messages
 - don't prompt user for victim if only one other active player
 - small AI change for strong and expert players: hold onto wild cards until later in the game
 
 Version 0.9.2              2011-05-16
 - allow rotation of display
 - allow for installation on SD card for Froyo and up
 - center of the table will look a little different in smallish landscape displays
   like a phone in landscape (put the current player/color/direction indicator to the
   right of the discard pile instead of beneath it)
 - removed "standard rules" to avoid copyright issues
 - card graphics revamped to avoid copyright issues
 - hand sorting: when in face up mode, sort all cards together (cards still are flagged
   as face up or face down even in this mode, and the system was sorting them separately)
 - AI improvements:
  - added color balance awareness; the more aggressive the player, the longer
    he is willing to try to preserve a nice even color balance in his hand
  - smarter play of the MAD card -- don't dump it if you're holding a ton of points
  - smarter play of the 69 card -- sometimes the 69 card keeps your score much
    lower (if you have hundreds of other points in your hand, it's a good card
    to keep)
  - smarter play of the Mystery Draw -- try to throw it only on numbered cards,
    with higher preference toward higher numbers, and special consideration of
    the 69 card
 - bugfix: at the end of a round, hit "Back", "Continue", "Back" -- crash
 - bugfix: if computer player went out on a Wild card, he wouldn't pick a color,
   and bad things would happen...

 Version 0.9.3				2011-05-16
 - bugfix: if you tap the card table immediately after starting a new game (and
   before the cards were dealt), you could cause a crash
   
 Version 1.0.0				2011-05-17
 - labeled as version 1.0.0 - released to market
 
 Version 1.0.1              2011-05-25
 
 - allow R Skip to be played on S and S Double; allow S and S Double to be played on R Skip
 
 - improved support for various displays (mdpi like HTC legend - 320x480, xhdpi,
   xlarge-mdpi, xlarge-hdpi)
   
 - bugfix: fixed java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in
   GameTable.findTouchedCard() > GameTable.findTouchedCardHand() > Hand.getCard()
 
 - bugfix: game would redeal when you changed orientation right after the deal
 
 - bugfix: crash when orientation changed while card info or card help dialog was showing
 
 - bugfix: crash when trying to access help on green reverse skip - typo!
 
 - bugfix: game could crash if it tried to grab a game state snapshot too early
 
 Version 1.0.2              2011-06-23

 - bugfix: if player is forced to draw more cards than are available in the draw pile
   plus the discard pile, game would lock up
   
 - bugfix: upon getting all bastard cards in hand, entire game would end; should have
   just ended the round and given 0 points to the lucky player

 - bugfix: previously, we required that you have the Quitter, Big Brother, and Retaliation
   at the end of a hand for the 1,000 point penalty; after some extensive research online,
   I believe that should only be the Quitter and the Retaliation
 
 - improved card docs so that all bastard cards' help contains the bastard card
   information
