Version 0.9                 2011-04-23
Initial Release


Version 0.9.1				2011-05-02
 - redraw table after player passes (so you can see the next player "thinking")
 - tap to dismiss card help dialog
 - graphical game winner messages
 - don't prompt user for victim if only one other active player
 - small AI change for strong and expert players: hold onto wild cards until later in the game
 
 Version 0.9.2
 - allow rotation of display
 - allow for installation on SD card for Froyo and up
 - center of the table will look a little different in smallish landscape displays
   like a phone in landscape (put the current player/color/direction indicator to the
   right of the discard pile instead of beneath it)
 - removed "standard rules" to avoid copyright issues
 - card graphics revamped to avoid copyright issues
 - hand sorting: when in face up mode, sort all cards together (cards still are flagged
   as face up or face down even in this mode, and the system was sorting them separately)
 - AI improvements:
  - added color balance awareness; the more aggressive the player, the longer
    he is willing to try to preserve a nice even color balance in his hand
  - smarter play of the MAD card -- don't dump it if you're holding a ton of points
  - smarter play of the 69 card -- sometimes the 69 card keeps your score much
    lower (if you have hundreds of other points in your hand, it's a good card
    to keep)
  - smarter play of the Mystery Draw -- try to throw it only on numbered cards,
    with higher preference toward higher numbers, and special consideration of
    the 69 card
 - bugfix: at the end of a round, hit "Back", "Continue", "Back" -- crash
 - bugfix: if computer player went out on a Wild card, he wouldn't pick a color,
   and bad things would happen...
