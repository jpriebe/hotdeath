FEATURES

- artwork:

  - scan additional card backgrounds for more realism
  
- game play loop
      
   - messages to clarify penalties like "South draws, takes penalty"

 Would be nice:
 
  - pause mechanism for novice players?  tap to advance after each card played...

  - if a matching card is played, you get a toast saying "North threw another green 5"; otherwise, it's a bit hard to see what happened
 
  - continue improving AI for computer players

Possible rules issues:
  - Quitter/Retaliation for 1000 points, or Quitter/Retaliation/Big Brother?  The former seems to be more commonly quoted
  - stacking Draw-2?
  - using Retaliation against Draw 2s?
  - dealer eating penalties on first face-up card
   
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Done:

- PNG drawable and APK filesize; I have 5 sets of cards embedded in the app; I had to use
  pngquant 128 on all the PNGs to optimize their filesize.  This cut the app from 13MB to
  6MB.  I tried going to 64 colors, but the results didn't look very good.

- timing problems with Toasts - reuse one Toast object so that when you show it, it immediately
  clears the last message instead of queueing up a list of toasts!

- don't allow cancelling of dialog prompts (setCancelable(false))

- ignore the screen orientation (via changes made to manifest)

- pause/unpause game thread -- use a boolean in the game class; synchronize
  all access to it
  
- state saving: Implement toJSON() methods in all game state objects; create JSONObject of game and its children; store string in Preferences;
  implement an alternate constructor for each game state object that takes a JSONObject as a parameter;
  when continuing, load the JSONObject from preferences; instantiate all objects using the information in this object.
  
- resolution independence:

   drawable-mdpi/card_*.png (cards are 80px tall)
   drawable-hdpi/card_*.png (cards are 120px tall)
   drawable-xhdpi/card_*.png (cards are 160px tall)
   drawable-xlarge-mdpi/card_*.png (cards are 120px tall)
   drawable-xlarge-hdpi/card_*.png (cards are 160px tall)
       
   (these follow the 3:4:6:8 scaling ratio for ldpi:mdpi:hdpi:xhdpi, and then
   I use larger images for the xlarge displays like tablets)
